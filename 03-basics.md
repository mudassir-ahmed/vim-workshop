# 03: basics

Type `vimtutor` in your terminal or `:h`. The documentation
is a good place to find out things vim can do that you
didn't know it could.

Vim is like a language. 
Operator/action followed by a motion or text object just 
like a sentence. Pro tip: always try to return to normal 
mode (hence the name).
