# 04: config

## How to edit vim configuration?
It's easy. You edit the file `.vimrc` usually found
in your home. This file is known as a dotfile.

## Example - relative line numbers
You might have noticed I've been using this feature.
It can be set by `:set number relativenumber`.

## Can I get plugins?
Yes! There are many plugins for vim. However, we will not
have enough time to have a showcase of popular ones.

## Plugin management?
Yes! You can use vim-plug for example.
