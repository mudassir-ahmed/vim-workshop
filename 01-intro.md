Free and open source ðŸš€. Based on `vi` which was released in 1976.

## How I am switching tabs that fast?
- I'm using the commands `gT` and `gt` to go back
and forth opened tabs respectively.
- And using `:prev` and `:next` to navigate files
opened on startup.
- See opened files using `:args`
- Quick find using `:find file_name` or `:b file_name_substring`
- I'm using `:Goyo` to display the text nicely (plugin)
